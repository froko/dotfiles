# bat

[bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) is a modern replacement for the `cat`
command, which provides syntax highlighting, line numbers, and other features.
The provided configuration in this dotfiles repository only sets the theme to
`Catppuccin Mocha`.

To use `bat` with the preconfigured theme, you have to run the following
command:

```bash
bat cache --build
```
