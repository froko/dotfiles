# Jetbrains

I use Jetbrains Rider for C# development at work. This directory contains the
.ideavim file to enable Vim keybindings in Rider and enhance it with some
additional features. Please note that the .ideavim file includes the .vimrc
file. Both files must be placed in the home directory to work properly.

## Rider Plugins

- Catpppuccin Theme: A beautiful theme for Rider that enhances the
  appearance of the IDE.
- IdeaVim: A plugin that enables Vim keybindings in Rider, allowing for a more
  efficient and familiar editing experience for Vim users.
- vim-flash: A plugin that provides a search and jump functionality similar
  to the Vim flash plugin, allowing for quick navigation within the codebase.
